MOVS
;If the direction flag is cleared (DF = 0), the RSI register is incremented after each string operation.
;If the direction flag is set (DF = 1), the RSI register is decremented after each string operation.

HIGHER PART CLEARING
;Copying a value in an 8-bit or 16-bit register does not clear the higher part
;of a 64-bit register.
;However, copying a value in a 32-bit register does clear the higher part of a
;64-bit register.
